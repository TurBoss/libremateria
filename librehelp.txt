**************************************
 1: Obtaining and installing Libre
**************************************
Seeing as you're reading this, there's a good chance
that you've already downloaded the program. However,
it's always possible that you'll want another copy,
especially when bugs are fixed. You have two options:

1. Go to the QHIMM forum thread for "Libre: FF7 Limit
Break Editor", or,

2. Visit http://libre-limitbreakeditorforff7.yolasite.com/
for both the most recent and older versions.

Depending on your operating system, you have two choices

1. WINDOWS 95/98/2000/XP/VISTA/7:
 Download the PC executable file, 'Libre FF7 for Windows'.
 Unzip and double-click 'Libre.exe'.

2. ANY SYSTEM with PYTHON and WXPYTHON (Linux and OSX 
have the first by default:
 Download the Python directory files. Unzip and run 
 Libre.pyw

**************************************
**************************************
 2. The Window Layout
**************************************
**************************************
If you've used NFITC1's WALLMARKET or PROUD CLOD programs,
you should recognize the basic setup. We can split the
controls into top-left, top-right, centre, targetting, 
elemental and miscellaneous (at the bottom).

TOP LEFT:

*****
ATK%:
*****
This determines the accuracy of the limit break. Most are set
to 255% by default.

******************************************
Impact / Target Animation / Impact Sound :
******************************************
These are three HEXADECIMAL values, each two bytes
(0-FFFF). These determine the graphical effects of the 
hit, the  target's flinching moves and the sound the
attack makes on impact. You should check the QHIMM
wiki for more info.

CAUTION: If you type in an invalid hexadecimal value
(for instance, '11GG'), it will instantly revert to
'0'.

**************
Animation ID:
**************
A single hex value that determines the animation used. 
Very little experimentation has been done with this, so
expect lots of glitches in-game if you alter this carelessly.

CAUTION: If you type in an invalid hexadecimal value
(for instance, '1G'), it will instantly revert to
'0'.

**************************
Camera Single/ Multiple:
**************************
These are two HEXADECIMAL values, each two bytes (0-FFFF).
These determine the way the camera moves during the limit,
depending on whether one or more enemies are being hit.

CAUTION: If you type in an invalid hexadecimal value
(for instance, '11GG'), it will instantly revert to
'00'.

TOP RIGHT:
****************
Status Effects:
****************
These are the active status effects that the limit will 
inflict, cure, or toggle. Explanations for each can be
found in Terrence Ferguson's Battle Mechanics FAQ over
on GameFAQs. A few caveats, though:

- in game, if an entity has dual WITHOUT dualdrain, or
  vice-versa, it will crash.
- don't inflict 'opposing' statuses (sad/fury;haste/slow
  etc.)

At the bottom is a 'status chance' control, that goes from
zero to sixty-three. This determines the chance of inflicting
a negative status in 'inflict' mode.

'Status Mode' can have three settings:
- INFLICT: Inflicts status (+ve or -ve) at the rate determined
  by 'Status Chance'
- CURE: Removes statuses. Doesn't miss.
- TOGGLE: Turns the selected statuses on if they're off, or off
  if they're on (e.g. - Mini can cause or cure a 'small' state)

CENTRAL:
*******************
Power / Algorithm:
*******************
Power is a value from zero to 255, that modifies the algorithm
chosen. Algorithms determine how damage is calculated.

TARGETTING:
******************
Enable Selection:
******************
Lets the players choose a target.

*********
One Row:
*********
If the cursor is by default on either enemies or allies, you're
bound by that choice. Summons, for instance, which can't be used
on the party, have the 'One Row' flag.

******************
Start on enemies:
******************
If true, the cursor starts on enemies. If not, it doesn't.
Important if you plan to use One Row (above).

**********
Unranged:
**********
If this is a physical attack, is it short range?

*******************
Start as multiple:
*******************
Does the cursor target the whole group of enemies / allies by
default?

**********
All rows:
**********
Attacks with this property target friend and foe alike.

*****************
Toggle multiple:
*****************
Does the cursor allow you to choose multiple or single enemies?

********
Random:
********
If this is on, the attack will hit a single, randomly selected
target from the group selected. Ahriman's Roulette has this.

MIDRIGHT:
**********
Elements:
**********
Assign the elements of the attack. 'Health' is used by curative
magic. Cut/shout/etc. are elements of particular weapons.

MISCELLANEOUS:
******************************
Additional Effect / Modifier:
******************************
Additional effects are... well, miscellaneous. They include things
like multiple hits (Omnislash) or Vincent's transformations. They
can modify the stats of those hit (like Dragon Force, or Hero
Drinks). 

Some effects have a modifer, 'M'. This is set in the '[M]' control
to the right.

***************
Special Flags:
***************
- Affect MP:
  Damage is done to MP rather than HP.
- Drain damage:
  10% of damage is done is drained by the caster/ user.
- Ignore status def:
  Will inflict statuses, even if enemy is immune.
- Drain HP/MP:
  Will drain both HP and a little MP.
- Reflectable:
  Attack can be reflected.
- Miss if alive:
  Most attacks can't hit the dead. Life / Life2 have 'Miss if alive',
  which ensures the opposite: it hits the KOed, but not the living.
- Ignore Def:
  Piercing, i.e. ignores Vitality / Spirit.
- No retarget:
  If the target becomes unhittable between being selected and being
  cast (ie if Tifa was killed before you get to cast Cure on her),
  'no retarget' prevents the usual retargetting of another valid entity.
- Critical:
  Hits are always critical. Omnislash has this.
- Force phys:
  Unused flag that forces attacks to be considered as physical, even
  if magical.

**************
Restore Type:
**************
If your attack restores HP, MP or status, you should set 'Restore Type'
accordingly, though it doesn't really seem to matter.

*********
MP Cost:
*********
It's the move's MP cost.

3. Opening/Saving/Selecting Limits
************************************
************************************
When Libre starts, you'll be faced with a 'blank' set of
limit breaks, starting with Braver. You can either work
from this, creating a set of limits from scratch, or load
limit data from the PC or PSOne versions of Final Fantasy
VII.

To load from the PC version, go to 'File', then 'Open PC
FF7 .exe', and find the FF7.exe file in your Final Fantasy
VII folder.

To load from the PSOne version, go to 'File', then 'Open
PSOne .mnu', and open a LIMTMENU.MNU file (which is located
on the game discs, at X:\MENU\LIMTMENU.MNU, where X is the
CD-ROM drive).

You can select the limit you want to work on with the drop-
down menubox at the top of the Window. If you switch limits,
then switch back, your changes will still be in memory.

Once you've finished, you can save your work by patching
either version of the game. Go to 'File', and then 'Patch
PC FF7.exe / PSOne .MNU'. Choose the file - again, FF7.exe
or LIMTMENU.MNU, and your changes will be saved to the game.

REMEMBER: Limit data in the KERNEL.BIN always trumps limit
data anywhere else. For this reason, you should use
NFITC1's WallMarket to edit:

* Tifa's limit breaks
* Cait Sith's limit breaks
* Vincent's limit **attacks** (but not his transformations)
* Cloud's finishing touch and blade beam attacks

If in doubt, edit both the MNU AND the KERNEL.BIN files.

WARNING: ALWAYS BACKUP THE FILES YOU ARE WORKING ON.
I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DATA LOSS, BE IT DOWN TO YOU
OR THE PROGRAM. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.

NOTE: The 'ALT' limit breaks are the secondary parts of Cloud's
Finishing Touch and Vincent's Satan Slam. Both are actually linked
pairs of attacks.

4. The Help Menu
******************
******************

'Help' just brings up this file. 'About' tells you a little about
the program. There's not much else to this : /

5. Bug Reports and Feedback
*****************************
*****************************

Being in 0.3 version, Libre's still a very young program. And bugs
happen, even in the simplest of programs. Thankfully, you can
contact me and I can clean up any errors. You can either send me
a PM / reply to the LIBRE thread on QHIMM, or send me an email at

jbreckmckye@hotmail.co.uk

I will answer and respond to emails at my own discretion. Mails in
txt spk or peppered with abusive language get deleted right away.
That said, I DO check my email, so DON'T BE PUT OFF if you notice
a bug. Make sure 'Libre' is in the topic, and include the following:
 - Your Operating System (XP, 7, Ubuntu, Arch, OS X Snow Leopard, etc)
 - Your Service Pack (Windows users) and Window Manager (Linuxers)
 - How you are running Libre (as EXE? Through WINE? as PY script?)
 - What happened, and what you had been doing beforehand
 - Did you cancel any operations?
 - Versions of Python, WxPython etc. used if appropriate
